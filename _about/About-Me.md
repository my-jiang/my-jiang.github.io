Hi there! My name is Iris Jiang. I will start the [Master of Quantitative Finance](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/programs/graduate-programs/master-quantitative-finance) at the [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca) in Fall 2022. I received my Bachelor of Mathematics at the [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca) in June 2022, majors in [Mathematical Finance](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/future-undergraduates/programs/mathematical-finance) and [Statistics](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), minors in [Pure Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/) and [Combinatorics and Optimization (C&O)](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/).



I am actively seeking coop/internship opportunity for Spring 2023 (May 2023 - Aug 2023). I am excited to explore more about [Quantitative Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)), [Portfolio Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization), [Statistical Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory) and [Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory). 



In my leisure time, I enjoy [GO (Weiqi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))  and a variety of sports (basketball, golf, badminton, etc).
