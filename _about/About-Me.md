Hi there! My name is Iris Jiang. I'm  a 4th-year candidate for Bachelor of Mathematics at the [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca), majors in [Mathematical Finance](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/future-undergraduates/programs/mathematical-finance) and [Statistics](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), minors in [Pure Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/) and [Computational Mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/computational-mathematics/).



I am excited to explore more about [Quantitative Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)), [Portfolio Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization), [Statistical Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory) and [Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory). I am also looking into some articles about [Sports Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_analytics) and I'm working on creating a simulation framework for NBA playoffs prediction.



In my leisure time, I enjoy [GO (Weiqi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))  and a variety of sports (basketball, badminton, etc).
