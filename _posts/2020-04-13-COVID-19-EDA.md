In winter 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. This project provides an exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 around the world with a focus on local situation in Canada. Besides of current analysis, I am also working on applying [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) to do some prediction. You can find the report from [COVID 19 Exploratory Data Analysis Report](../projects/COVID-19-EDA/COVID-19-EDA.html). The report will be updated frequently.
