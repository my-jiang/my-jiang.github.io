The course is designed to fill the gap between advanced math courses and regular stream, formal course description can be found [here](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/PMATH/333).

### My Thoughts:

I took the course in fall 2019 with doctor Ben Passer. The course starts from generating the real line, using the idea of Dedekind cut. Then it introduces some basic properties about $$\mathbb{R}$$, e.g. boundedness, supremum/infimum, and then it introduces sequence and series, (limit points, convergence, completeness). And then move to functions on $$\mathbb{R}$$, continuity, differentiability, etc.

The second half is a more general application on $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. Starting from topology, it allows us to discuss continuity using the idea of topology, which becomes much more abstract. Then it introduces the properties of functions on $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, pointwise/uniform continuity. And the idea of pointwise/uniform convergence of functions. Lastly, it talks about the properties of power series and Taylor series
