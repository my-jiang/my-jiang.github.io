Cross-list with [ACTSC 973](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/graduate-course/subject/ACTSC#973). Formal course description can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/graduate-course/subject/CO#778).

### My Thoughts:

I took the course in spring 2020 with professor Ben Feng. Covered almost the same topics as CO372 with deeper and harder concepts. Contained certain amount of coding and algorithm developing.
