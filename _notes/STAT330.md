### My Thoughts:

I took the course in fall 2019 with Prof. Reza Ramezan. Easy concepts through the first half of the course, discussing random variables transformation, etc. It gets hard (and more interesting) when introducing the convergence in probability, convergence in distribution, etc in the last half of the course.
