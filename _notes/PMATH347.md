- [Final Review](../notes-pdf/PMATH347Final.pdf)

The official course notes organized by Prof. Ross Willard can be found in his personal website: [group theory](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rdwillar/Courses/PM347-F20/grouptheory.pdf), [ring theory](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rdwillar/Courses/PM347-F20/ringtheory.pdf).

Formal course description can be found [here](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/PMATH/347).

### My Thoughts:

I took the course in Fall 2020 with Prof. Ross Willard. An entry-level pure math course, similar to MATH135.
