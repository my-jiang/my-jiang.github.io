### My Thoughts:

I took the course in spring 2020 with Prof. Stephen New. This course is mostly a generalization of PMATH333. The continuity, separability, completeness and compactness are introduced in matric spaces rather than in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ as learned from PMATH333. This is a relatively easy course if the content in PMATH333 are well understood.
